# Chitter-Chat
A chat application consists of a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., React.js), communicating with a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express.js) handling user authentication, message storage in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL), and real-time communication via WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).
